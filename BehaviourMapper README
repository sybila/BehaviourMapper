Execution:
	Behaviour Mapper is a java CLI tool which parses the provided input data and saves a graph to the desired location.
	(Note that file extension for the output file is added automatically.)
Arguments:
	java -jar BehaviourMapper.jar <input_file> <output_file>
	input_file - Location of Behaviour Mapper input file (Parsybone output file).
	output_file - The file in which the xgmml graph will be stored.

Output:
	Graph file formatted as xgmml for Cytoscape.
	The width and height of graph nodes is directly proportional to number of inboud and outbound transitions (respectively) of the state it represents.
	Nodes representing a state that represents a measurement in the time series are highlighted.
	The width of an edge is directly proportional to the number of transitions that use it.
