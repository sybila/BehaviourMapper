	Behaviour Mapper is a Java CLI tool which parses a Parsybone output file ( http://sybila.fi.muni.cz/tools ) and produces a graph representation of its respective transition system.

Requirements:
	Java Runtime Environment 7.x or newer. 

Arguments:
	java -jar BehaviourMapper.jar <input_file> <output_file>
	input_file - Location of Behaviour Mapper input file (Parsybone output file).
	output_file - The file in which the xgmml graph will be stored. The extension .xgmml is added automatically.

Output:
	An XGMML graph. To display the file we suggest usage of the Cytoscape tool ( http://www.cytoscape.org/ )
	The width and height of graph nodes is directly proportional to number of inbound and outbound transitions (respectively) of the state it represents.
	Nodes representing a state that corresponding to a measurement in the time series are highlighted.
	The width of an edge is directly proportional to the number of parametrizations sharing the edge in their time series walks.
